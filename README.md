
## Running Instructions:
* Make sure that the device is unloaded or the device with same name doesn't exist. Type "sudo ./scull_unload".
* Load the scull buffer using command "sudo ./scull_load". This will create a device called /dev/scullbuffer.
* In case the number of items have to be specified by the user then type "sudo ./scull_load <nitems>" where nitems is a placeholder.
* Type make command to compile all relevant files.
* The test cases are present in a file called testcase.sh. 
* This script takes the test case number as the parameter. To execute a test case type "./testcase.sh <testcasenumber>" where <testcasenumber> is placeholde for testcase number.

## Output Format:
* The producers each write the item they have produced into their respective log files. 
* The log file of a producer has the following format: Prod<third-arg>.log where the <third-arg> is the parameter passed to the producer which is the name of   item that a particular producer will produce. For example: if producer writes items called "blue" then its output would be in file Prodblue.log.
* The consumers each write the item they have consumed into their respective log files.
   The log file of a consumer has the following format: Cons<second-arg>.log where <second-arg> is the parameter passed to the consumer program which is an id   entifier for a consumer. This argument must be unique per consumer.

## Test Case Description:

### Testcase #1: 
--------------------
This test case consists of a single producer consumer each of which produce and consume 50 items respectively.

### Execution: 
Type "./testcase.sh 1" to execute this test case. The producer output can be seen in file Prod_case1_red.log and the consumer output can be seen in the file Cons_case1.log.

### Expected Output: 
The producer and consumer must exit normally and the consumer must consume all the 50 items.   

### Testcase #2:
--------------------
This test case consists of a single producer and consumer. The producer will try to produce 50 items before exiting and the consumer consumes only 10 items and exits. 
   
### Execution:
Type "./testcase.sh 2" to execute this test case. The producer output can be seen in file Prod_case2_red.log and the consumer output can be seen in the file Cons_case2.log.

### Expected Output: 
Depending on the size of the scull buffer the producer can deposit (scullbuffersize/32) + 10 items into the scull buffer and exit once the consumer exits. The consumer will read 10 items and exit.
   
### Testcase #3:
--------------------
This test case consists of a single producer and consumer. The producer produces 50 items before exiting and the consumer consumes 100 items before exiting.

### Execution:
Type "./testcase.sh 3" to execute this test case. The producer output can be seen in file Prod_case3_red.log and the consumer output can be seen in the file Cons_case3.log.

### Expected Output:
The producer will write 50 items into the scull buffer regardless of the scull buffer size. The consumer will consumer 50 items before exiting since there are no producers.

### Testcase #4:
-------------
This test consists of two producers and one consumer. Each producer produces 50 items and the consumer will try to consumer 200 items before exiting.

### Execution:
----------------------
Type "./testcase.sh 4" to execute this test case. The producer output can be seen in file Prod_case4_red.log and Prod_case4_black.log. The consumer output can be seen in Cons_case4.log.

### Expected Output:
-----------------
Both the items will produce 50 items regardless of the scullbuffer size and the consumer will exit after consuming 100 items.

### Testcase #5:
------------
This test consists of one producer and two consumers. The producer will produce 50 items and the two consumers together (or individually) will consume the 50 items.

### Execution:
---------------------
Type "./testcase.sh 5" to execute this test case. The producer output can be seen in the file Prod_case5_red.log. The consumers output can be seen in the two log files Cons_case5_1.log and Cons_case5_2.log.

### Expected Output:
----------------
The producer will produce 50 items regardless of the scullbuffer size. The consumers will consumer variable number of items that add upto 50 items combined.
